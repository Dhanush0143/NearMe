As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a prominent Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy temple specifically known in Tirupathur, Tamil Nadu.
However, there might be smaller or lesser-known temples dedicated to Lord Murugan(Subramaniya Swamy) in various parts of Tirupathur or nearby areas.
If you're specifically looking for information about an Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy temple in Tirupathur, I would recommend checking with local residents
or authorities in Tirupathur for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
