Tirupathur, nestled in the southern part of India, holds a special place in my heart as my hometown. Situated in the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, Tirupathur is a town rich in history, culture, and natural beauty.
At the heart of Tirupathur lies its vibrant marketplaces, where the bustle of daily life unfolds amidst the colorful array of shops and vendors. From aromatic spice stalls to bustling textile markets, 
the town's commerce thrives, reflecting its dynamic economy.
