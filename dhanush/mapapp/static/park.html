As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a prominent park known as "Pasathuragiri Hill Forest Park" specifically in Tirupathur, Tamil Nadu. 
However, there might be lesser-known or newly developed parks or recreational areas in or around Tirupathur that I may not be aware of.
If you're specifically looking for information about Pasathuragiri Hill Forest Park or any other park in Tirupathur, I would recommend 
checking with local residents, tourism authorities, or online resources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
