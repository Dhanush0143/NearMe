Tirupathur, nestled in the southern part of India, holds a special place in my heart as my hometown. Situated in the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, Tirupathur is a town rich in history, culture, and natural beauty.
At the heart of Tirupathur lies its vibrant marketplaces, where the bustle of daily life unfolds amidst the colorful array of shops and vendors. From aromatic spice stalls to bustling textile markets,

As of my last update in January 2022, there isn't a prominent Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy temple specifically known in Tirupathur, Tamil Nadu.
However, there might be smaller or lesser-known temples dedicated to Lord Murugan(Subramaniya Swamy) in various parts of Tirupathur or nearby areas.
If you're specifically looking for information about an Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy temple in Tirupathur, I would recommend checking with local residents
or authorities in Tirupathur for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
